# docker-wordpress-wp-cli-xdebug-newrelic

This image adds New Relic support to [`docker-wordpress-wp-cli-xdebug`](https://github.com/johnrom/docker-wordpress-wp-cli-xdebug). 

**This is super untested.** Do not use in production. I built this on Windows so permissions are not correct. Maybe one day I will fix it.

## Setting Up

- Follow the documentation for [`docker-wordpress-wp-cli-xdebug`](https://github.com/johnrom/docker-wordpress-wp-cli-xdebug).
- Register for a New Relic Account
- TODO
